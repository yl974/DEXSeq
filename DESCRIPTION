Title: Inference of differential expression and splicing in RNA-Seq
Author: Simon Anders <sanders@fs.tum.de> and Alejandro Reyes <areyes@lcg.unam.mx>, both at EMBL Heidelberg

Description: The package is focused on finding differential 
   exon usage using RNA-seq exon counts from samples with 
   different experimental designs. It provides functions 
   that allows the user to make the necessary statistical 
   tests based on a model that uses the negative binomial 
   distribution to estimate the variance between biological 
   replicates. The package also provides functions for the 
   visualization and exploration of the results.
