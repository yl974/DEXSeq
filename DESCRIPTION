Description: The package is focused on finding differential
   exon usage using RNA-seq exon counts between samples with
   different experimental designs. It provides functions that
   allows the user to make the necessary statistical tests based
   on a model that uses the negative binomial distribution to
   estimate the variance between biological replicates and
   generalized linear models for testing. The package also
   provides functions for the visualization and exploration of
   the results.
