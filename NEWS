-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


    o A parameter -r was added to the python scripts, that allow the users either to ignore the exonic bins belonging to several genes and treat the genes separately, or merge the genes into an aggregate gene. The equivalent R implementations of the python scripts were finally added.

CHANGES IN version 1.7.14
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


    o Changes to vignette to provide more of an end-to-end description of the work flow.

    o Added appendix explaining TRT to vignette.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.7
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES



    o Major code revisions: the ExonCountSet object was deprecated and substituted by the DEXSeqDataSet class,
      a subclass of the DESeqDataSet.
    o DEXseq now uses the DESeq2 package as internal engine and backbone for all analyses
    o All functions and methods for the ExonCountSet object were replaced by new functions
    o DEXSeq is now better integrated with other Bioconductor packages
    o We now use knitr to build the vignette
