- Changes to the documentation and to the vignette.  New functions added and more support for gene names and strange exonids.

2011-07-12: version 0.1.11

- Parallelization possibility added to the code, with its description in the vignette and single exon genes ignored properly.

2011-07-01: version 0.1.10

- 'estimateSizeFactors' and 'estimatedispersions' function added as S4 methods, no more problems when loading DESeq and DEXSeq in the same R session

2012-05-21: version 1.3.2

- More options and flexibilty added to "estimatelog2FoldChanges"

2012-06-26: version 1.3.3

- Now any function relies on the order of the levels of the factors.

2012-11-28: version 1.5.3

- The TRT method is implemented, for people with a big number of samples without completions or speed issues

2013-02-27: version 1.5.3

- A parameter -r was added to the python scripts, that allow the users either to ignore the exonic bins belonging
  to several genes and treat the genes separately, or merge the genes into an aggregate gene. The equivalent R implementations
  of the python scripts were finally added.
